Just Finished My Mini Project – Captionify 🧠📸
(An AI-powered image caption generator)

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on a fun yet impactful mini project called Captionify — a web app that uses Google’s Gemini API to generate creative, engaging Instagram-style captions just by uploading an image.

📷 Let AI see and say it for you!

🔍 What Captionify Does:
✅ Upload any image
✅ Instantly get an AI-generated caption (with emojis & hashtags)
✅ Built with HTML, TailwindCSS & JavaScript
✅ Integrated with Google's Gemini Vision model (API)

💡Why I Built It:
I wanted to explore the power of multimodal AI, especially how AI can interpret and describe visual content in a human-like way.
 Captionify was a great opportunity to:
Work with real-world APIs
Improve my frontend and UX design skills
Build something useful (and a little fun too!)

🎯 Tech Stack:
HTML | Tailwind CSS | JavaScript | Gemini API (Vision) | Google Cloud
